      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>The Literary Mindfulness Meditation is a web application primarily for use by individuals with Parkinson's Disease (PD) and their caretakers to help deal with negative thoughts and anxiety.</p>

      <p>The goal of the application is to help a user with PD, caretakers of those with PD, or the general public build resilience, reduce stress, and improve their Quality of Life (QoL).</p>

      <p>
        The user will use the application and each session will consist of the following phases: 
        Read inspirational quotes on such topics as hope, positivity, and persistence for 1-2 minutes while meditating and thinking about the reading. Quotes are going to be accompanied with artwork (+ possibly meditating music) As part of active reflection, the user will write down their feelings after reading the quote and meditating. Repeat five times per week and, for users with Parkinson's Disease or caretakers who opt in, the application will provide the user with a PDPR (Parkinson's Disease Progress Report), which includes a summary of weekly activities and survey that inquires about the user's well-being.
      </p>

      <p>Literary Medicine and Active Reflection are tools that are not yet utilized in helping to improve the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's disease and could potentially provide a source of comfort for the patients, their caretakers, and anyone struggling with anxiety.</p>
